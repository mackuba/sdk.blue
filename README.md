# sdk.blue

A list of libraries, frameworks and tools for the Bluesky API and AT Protocol. See the website here: <https://sdk.blue>.

## Adding projects

If you've created a library or SDK that you'd like to be listed on this page, please [send a pull request](https://tangled.org/mackuba.eu/sdk.blue/pulls).

Note: this is meant to be a curated list with only specific kinds of projects, not a list of all projects related to Bluesky and ATProto.

What kinds of projects I'm looking for:

* full SDKs for building things on ATProto in a given language
* targetted libraries for things like streaming from the firehose, making XRPC calls, building feeds, labellers etc.
* template repos for making e.g. labeller or feed projects using your library
* tools and helper services that can be used as part of a larger app

So generally repos that contain code that you could use to build your thing.

Additionally, I'm also including:

* independent implementations of things like PDS, relay, or Bluesky AppView
* example full non-Bluesky ATProto apps like Tangled or Leaflet

What I'm *not* looking for:

* client apps, user-facing tools, webapps, command-line tools etc.
* specific examples of bots, labellers, feeds etc.
